The Recent Places folder is quite useful in Windows 8 and Windows 7 because it maintains the lists of all folders that the user has visited in the past. Or in other words, we can say it is similar to a Recent History that most third-party tools offer. That is why the Recent Places is a very simple way of displaying the last visited place very accurately.

* Start your Windows 8 installed system.
* Open My Computer by double-clicking on the "My Computer" icon, as in.
* Find "Recent places" listed under the Favorites on the left sidebar in Windows Explorer. And double-click on the "Recent places" folder, then you will see the contents of the Recent places folder but in an unsorted order.

## Add ‘Recent Folders’ to Quick Access Menu

* Open a new instance of a File Explorer window (WinKey + E)
* Copy/Paste the code into the explorer address bar and press the Enter key
* Right-click the “Quick Access” entry on the far-left side of the File Explorer window and click the “Pin current folder to Quick Access” option.
* Drag the newly-added Recent folder entry to the position you prefer. I place the entry on the top of the list on my PC.

## Add ‘Recent folders’ to Open/Save Dialog

* Open any program from which you would save a file and issue the Save command. Note: some programs may require you to make a basic edit to a new document.
* In the file location bar, paste the same code from above:
	* shell:::{22877a6d-37a1-461a-91b0-dbda5aaebc99}
* Right-click the “Quick Access” entry on the far-left side of the File Explorer window and click the “Pin current folder to Quick Access” option.
* Again, drag the newly-added Recent folder entry to the position you prefer.
